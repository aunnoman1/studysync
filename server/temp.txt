Question: what is function
Context:
[1] (Supabase) This chapter first discusses the functions previously defined and then discusses user-
defined functions.
Let us imagine an automobile factory. When an automobile is manufactured, it is 
not made from basic raw materials; it is put together from previously manufactured 
parts. Some parts are made by the company itself; others, by different companies.
Functions are like building blocks. They let you divide complicated programs into 
manageable pieces. They have other advantages, too:
??
While working on one function, you can focus on just that part of the
[2] (Supabase) Functions are often called modules. They are like miniature programs; you can put 
them together to form a larger program. When user-defined functions are discussed, 
you will see that this is the case. This ability is less apparent with predefined functions 
because their programming code is not available to us. However, because predefined 
functions are already written for us, you will learn these first so that you can use them 
when needed.
Predefined Functions
Before formally discussing predefined functions in C11, let us review a concept
[3] (Supabase) QUICK REVIEW
1.	
Functions, also called modules, are like miniature programs.
2.	
Functions enable you to divide a program into manageable tasks.
3.	
The C11 system provides the standard (predefined) functions.
4.	
To use a standard function, you must
 i.  Know the name of the header file that contains the function’s 
specification,
 ii.  Include that header file in the program, and
iii.  Know the name and type of the function and number and types of 
the parameters (arguments).
5.	
There are two types of user-defined functions: value-returning func-
tions and void functions.

, where 1, 2, and 3 are the arguments of the function f, and 7, 
9, and 11 are the corresponding values of f.
In C11, the concept of a function, either predefined or user-defined, is similar to 
that of a function in algebra. For example, every function has a name and, depending 
on the values specified by the user, it does some computation. This section discusses 
various predefined functions.
[5] (Supabase) a function is a set of statements whose objective is to accomplish something. The 
preceding program consists of only the function main; all C11 programs require the 
function main.
The first four lines of the program begins with the pair of symbols // (shown in 
green), which are comments. Comments are for the user; they typically explain the 
purpose of the programs, that is, the meaning of the statements. (We will elaborate 
on how to include comments in a program later in this chapter.) The next line of the 
program, that is,
#include <iostream>
Answer concisely based only on the context above.

LLM RESPONSE:
================================================================================
 This program defines functions, both predefined and user-defined. It also includes comments, which are used to provide additional information about the code. The purpose of this program is to teach users how to use functions in C11.
[6]  (Supabase) a function can have several statements; it does not need to contain only one statement. In the preceding example, the function main has three statements: a declaration that includes the type (T) and number (N) of parameters that may be used by the function, an initial value for the parameter, and a pair of symbols ~~ 
// ~~that is, two backslashes followed by each other. These are comments.

You can use the ~~ symbols to include multiple lines in a comment.
[7]  (Supabase) predefined functions are those which have been written for you and used many times. You don’t write them yourself; they were written once, packaged, and distributed with the standard C11 program. They contain their own set of instructions or statements, but you need not write any statements to use them. You only have to remember the name of the header file that includes the function you want to use.
The following is a list of standard functions in C11:
1    int
int  (Supabase) defines an integer type. An integer is an integral number that is either 
positive or negative but never non-integer. For example, 5 and -3 are integers; 3.14 
is not because it is a decimal fraction.
2    double
double  (Supabase) defines a floating-point type. This type stores floating-point numbers. 
These types are used to store real numbers that have decimals in them, but the number 
can also be positive or negative. For example, 
float x = 3; // x is assigned the value of an integer: 3
3    int i
int  (Supabase) defines an integer type as we stated earlier.
4    long int
long int (Supabase) defines a larger integer type called long integer. Long integers can 
be used to store even larger numbers than integers, but these values are typically not 
used in practice because the number of digits required is very large for such 
large numbers.
5    char
char  (Supabase) defines an 8-bit signed character type, which is usually sufficient to 
store single characters and some ASCII symbols. It allows a single byte in memory to 
contain one character that can be used by the operating system as part of its data 
structures and stored on disk for later use.
6    bool
bool (Supabase) defines a type whose values are either true or false, which we call 
Boolean. This is often referred to as a logical type because it can be used in logical 
operations such as the AND and OR operators.
7    void
void  (Supabase) defines an empty function that does not return any value. Any statement 
in this function can only execute if you have already called the function first. The 
program must include a pair of symbols that is used to indicate the end of statements in 
this type of function. These are the symbol }; followed by another ; ~~ ~~that is, two 
backslashes followed by each other. To define this kind of function, 
void main (int argc, char *argv[]) { } ~~ ~~would be used; here, ~~ ~~is a pair of 
backslashes followed by each other; } means the end of statements in a void type.
8    unsigned int
unsigned int (Supabase) defines an integer type whose values are either 0 or greater than zero. 
9    char[]
char []  (Supabase) defines a character array, which is simply an array of characters. 
The size of the array is indicated by its length, and each element in the array has 
its own index number. You can store as many elements into this type of function as you 
would like. You must include the ~~ symbol after the name of the type to indicate that 
the statement on the following line is a comment, not part of the program. This 
statement indicates how many characters will be in the array: ~~char size[];.
The variable char *argv[] has been used above as an example of parameters; these are 
variables with types that can hold values from inside the function to outside it. In the 
previous line, the value char [ ] was passed into the function, where the first argument is
the number of characters in the array and the second parameter is the array itself, which 
is called a pointer; this is shown by the variable *argv. It can be used to pass data 
between functions or between a program and an external tool such as a calculator.
10    unsigned int x
unsigned int x (Supabase) ~~(1) is similar to integer type, but it has only positive values.
11    double y = 3.14; // Assigns the value of 3.14 to the variable y, which can be used later in the program
double y ~~(2) ~~(3) ~~(4) is a floating-point type that stores real numbers with decimals.
