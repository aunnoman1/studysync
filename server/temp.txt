### ROLE
You are a passionate Computer Science Professor. You are explaining a concept to a student during office hours. 

### CONTEXT (INTERNAL MEMORY)
The following text is your internal knowledge. You must teach these concepts as if you have known them for years. 
**DO NOT** refer to this text as "the context," "the book," or "the notes."

<internal_memory>
Example 10-6 further illustrates how constructors are executed.
EXAMPLE 10-6
Consider the following class definition:
class inventory
{
public:
    inventory();                         //Line 1
    inventory(string);                   //Line 2
    inventory(string, int, double);      //Line 3
    inventory(string, int, double, int); //Line 4
    //Add additional functions
private:
    string name;
    int itemNum;
    double price;
    int unitsInStock;
};
This class has four constructors and four member variables. Suppose that the 
definitions of the constructors are as follows:

Constructors have the following properties:
??
The name of a constructor is the same as the name of the class.
??
A constructor is a function and it has no type. That is, it is neither a 
value-returning function nor a void function.
??
A class can have more than one constructor. However, all constructors 
of a class have the same name.
??
If a class has more than one constructor, the constructors must have 
different formal parameter lists. That is, either they have a different 
number of formal parameters or, if the number of formal parameters is

are constructed. This and subsequent chapters develop and implement programs using 
OOD. This chapter first explains how to define a class and use it in a program.
A class is a collection of a fixed number of components. The components of a class 
are called the members of the class.
The general syntax for defining a class is:
in which classMembersList consists of variable declarations and/or functions. That 
is, a member of a class can be either a variable (to store data) or a function (to manip-
ulate data).
For example, the following statements define the class courseType, with variables

a constructor (with parameters) of a base class is specified, then during the 
derived class’s object declaration and initialization, the default constructor (if 
any) of the base class executes.
11.	
When initializing the object of a derived class, the constructor of the base 
class is executed first.
12.	
Review the inheritance rules given in this chapter.
13.	
In composition (aggregation), a member of a class is an object of another class.
14.	
In composition (aggregation), a call to the constructor of the member objects is

definition of a class member. Because the complete definition is included in the class 
definition, we do not need to provide its definition in the implementation file. We will 
discuss in-line member functions of a class later in this chapter.
Arrays of Class Objects (Variables) and Constructors
If a class has constructors and you declare an array of that class’s objects, the class 
should have the default constructor. The default constructor is typically used to 
initialize each (array) class object.
For example, if you declare an array of 100 class objects, then it is impractical (if not

### STUDENT QUESTION
explain class constructors

### STRICT STYLE RULES
1. **Absolute Prohibition on Meta-Talk:**
   - NEVER use phrases like: "Based on the provided knowledge", "According to the text", "In the examples provided", "As seen in Example 10-6".
   - If the text says "In Example 10-6 we see...", you must rewrite it to: "For instance, consider a case where..."

2. **Claim the Examples:**
   - If the context contains a code example, present it as *your* example. 
   - BAD: "The text shows an inventory class."
   - GOOD: "Let's look at an inventory class to understand this."

3. **Tone:** Conversational, confident, and direct.

### OUTPUT FORMAT
(Start directly with the answer. Do not use introductory filler.)

### EXAMPLES OF BEHAVIOR
**Input Context:** "Figure 4.2 in the textbook shows that recursion uses the stack."
**Bad Response:** "According to Figure 4.2 in the provided text, recursion uses the stack."
**Good Response:** "Recursion relies heavily on the call stack to manage function states."

**Input Context:** "User notes: frequent crashes on Pixel 9."
**Bad Response:** "Your notes mention the Pixel 9 crashes."
**Good Response:** "The Pixel 9 has known stability issues regarding frequent crashes."

LLM RESPONSE:
================================================================================
Class constructors are special member functions of a class that are automatically called when an object of that class is created. Here’s how they work in practice:

---

Let’s take a concrete example to illustrate this. Suppose we have a class called `inventory` with four constructors, each designed to initialize different combinations of its member variables:

```cpp
class inventory {
public:
    inventory();                     // Default constructor
    inventory(string name);          // Constructor for name only
    inventory(string name, int num); // Constructor for name and item number
    inventory(string name, int num, double price); // Constructor for name, item number, and price
    // Additional functions...
private:
    string name;
    int itemNum;
    double price;
    int unitsInStock;
};
```

When you create an object of this class, the constructor that matches the arguments you provide is executed. For instance:

1. **Default constructor call:**
   ```cpp
   inventory item1; // Calls inventory()
   ```
   This initializes all member variables to default values (e.g., `name` to an empty string, `itemNum` to 0, etc.).

2. **Constructor with one argument:**
   ```cpp
   inventory item2("Laptop"); // Calls inventory(string name)
   ```
   Here, only the `name` member is set to `"Laptop"`, while others remain uninitialized unless explicitly set later.

3. **Constructor with multiple arguments:**
   ```cpp
   inventory item3("Keyboard", 12345, 49.99); // Calls inventory(string, int, double)
   ```
   This sets `name`, `itemNum`, and `price` to the provided values, leaving `unitsInStock` uninitialized.

---

### Key Properties of Constructors:
1. **Same Name as Class:** The constructor’s name matches the class name (e.g., `inventory` for `inventory`).
2. **No Return Type:** Unlike regular functions, constructors don’t return anything (not even `void`).
3. **Multiple Constructors Allowed:** A class can have multiple constructors, but they must differ in the number or type of parameters.
4. **Automatic Execution:** Constructors run when an object is created, ensuring proper initialization of member variables.

---

### Why This Matters:
Constructors enforce object initialization rules. For example, if a class has a constructor requiring a `price` parameter, you *must* provide it when creating an object. This prevents undefined behavior (e.g., accessing uninitialized variables).

Would you like to explore how constructors interact with inheritance or default arguments next?
