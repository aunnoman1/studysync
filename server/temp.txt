Question: what is function
Context:
[1] (Supabase) This chapter first discusses the functions previously defined and then discusses user-
defined functions.
Let us imagine an automobile factory. When an automobile is manufactured, it is 
not made from basic raw materials; it is put together from previously manufactured 
parts. Some parts are made by the company itself; others, by different companies.
Functions are like building blocks. They let you divide complicated programs into 
manageable pieces. They have other advantages, too:
??
While working on one function, you can focus on just that part of the
[2] (Supabase) Functions are often called modules. They are like miniature programs; you can put 
them together to form a larger program. When user-defined functions are discussed, 
you will see that this is the case. This ability is less apparent with predefined functions 
because their programming code is not available to us. However, because predefined 
functions are already written for us, you will learn these first so that you can use them 
when needed.
Predefined Functions
Before formally discussing predefined functions in C11, let us review a concept
[3] (Supabase) QUICK REVIEW
1.	
Functions, also called modules, are like miniature programs.
2.	
Functions enable you to divide a program into manageable tasks.
3.	
The C11 system provides the standard (predefined) functions.
4.	
To use a standard function, you must
 i.  Know the name of the header file that contains the function’s 
specification,
 ii.  Include that header file in the program, and
iii.  Know the name and type of the function and number and types of 
the parameters (arguments).
5.	
There are two types of user-defined functions: value-returning func-
tions and void functions.
6.

f

, where 1, 2, and 3 are the arguments of the function f, and 7, 
9, and 11 are the corresponding values of f.
In C11, the concept of a function, either predefined or user-defined, is similar to 
that of a function in algebra. For example, every function has a name and, depending 
on the values specified by the user, it does some computation. This section discusses 
various predefined functions.
[5] (Supabase) a function is a set of statements whose objective is to accomplish something. The 
preceding program consists of only the function main; all C11 programs require the 
function main.
The first four lines of the program begins with the pair of symbols // (shown in 
green), which are comments. Comments are for the user; they typically explain the 
purpose of the programs, that is, the meaning of the statements. (We will elaborate 
on how to include comments in a program later in this chapter.) The next line of the 
program, that is,
#include <iostream>
